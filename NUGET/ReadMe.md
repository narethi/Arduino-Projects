## READ ME

This will hold the projects that will need to be reused over and over, this will be moved to its own repo later. This contains:

* USB to Serial 
  * This contains a basic serial in and serial out that can be used with windows (I am currently using this for input from windows to arduino and windows to TTL serial adapters).
